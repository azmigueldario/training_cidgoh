    "\n",
    "After a sequencing experiment, the data is available as reads (representations of sections of nucleotides) and typically available in [fastq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) format. The length of the reads and the quality of the assigned nucleotides depends largely on the processing steps and the technology used (Illumina, Nanopore, PacBio).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our analysis are done in a High Performance Computing cluster as most tools are resource intensive and performing analysis on your local computer would be too time consuming. The currently used cluster is **Compute Canada (CC cluster)**, you can login using the instructions available in the [wiki page for new users](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/SSH). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **CC cluster**, there are several tools already available to be used as modules. This environment (computing system) has reproduced this setup and you can use a similar command to load software. `module load desired_software/version`\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually installing tools can create conflicts and errors. Thus, we will use containers (ready to use packages to run a software tool). Singularity containers are executed using the command `singularity run tool_image` or `singularity exec tool_image command`. There is no need to download said containers as they should be readily available once you connect to this server. \n",
